This component manages a queue of notifications that needs to be displayed to the user.
Comes with a little iPhone app demo, commented code and a docset ready to be installed in Xcode.

To display a notification:

- 1. Create an instance of the notification model:

  LLNotify *notification = [LLNotify notification];
 
- 2. Change it's properties to suit your needs:

  notification.type = LLNotifyTypeError;
  notification.targetView = viewFromWhereToDisplayTheNotification;
  notification.title = @"A notification";
  notification.message = @"This is a notification message!";
  notification.icon = [UIImage imageNamed:@"icon_error"];
  notification.position = LLNotifyPositionTop;
  notification.showAnimation = LLNotifyAnimationSlideDown;
  notification.hideAnimation = LLNotifyAnimationSlideUp;
  notification.hideTimeout = 3;
  
- 3. Add the notification to the queue and call showNotifications to display pending notifications in the queue:
 
  [notifyManager addNotificationToQueue:notification];
  [notifyManager showNotifications];

- 4. Done!
